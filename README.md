# Trump-Bot
Stochastic text generation and predictive text using hidden Markov models and a corpus consisting of DJT's tweets.

To run, open the .py and change the directory on line 20 to wherever you stored trump.txt.
Run the program.
`make_quote()` attempts to generate two sentences.
`interactive_mode()` is less entertaining, but attempts to predict the next word based on the previous word.
